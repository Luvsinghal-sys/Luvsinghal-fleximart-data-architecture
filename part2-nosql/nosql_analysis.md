# Task 2.1: NoSQL Justification Report - FlexiMart

## Section A: Limitations of RDBMS
A traditional RDBMS like MySQL would struggle with FlexiMart’s expansion for several reasons. First, products now have highly diverse attributes; for example, electronics require fields for RAM and processors, while fashion items require size and material. In a relational model, this forces a "sparse" table with many NULL values or a complex EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) design that is difficult to maintain. Second, frequent schema changes when adding new categories require expensive 'ALTER TABLE' operations that can cause downtime. Finally, storing customer reviews as nested data is inefficient in SQL. It requires a separate table and costly JOIN operations to retrieve a product alongside its reviews, which significantly slows down performance as the catalog grows.

## Section B: NoSQL Benefits (MongoDB)
MongoDB provides a superior solution through its document-oriented structure. Its flexible schema allows different products to store unique fields in the same collection without rigid table definitions. This is ideal for FlexiMart’s varied inventory. By using embedded documents, MongoDB can store customer reviews directly within the product document. This "data locality" means a single read operation retrieves everything at once, eliminating the need for JOINs. Additionally, MongoDB’s horizontal scalability through sharding ensures that as FlexiMart’s traffic increases, the database can distribute data across multiple servers easily, providing much better performance under high load than a vertically scaled RDBMS.

## Section C: Trade-offs
While MongoDB offers flexibility, it has two main disadvantages compared to MySQL for a product catalog. First, it lacks the strict ACID compliance found in RDBMS for complex, multi-table transactions; if inventory and financial records must stay perfectly synced in real-time, MySQL is more reliable. Second, the use of embedded documents can lead to significant data duplication. For instance, if a user changes their username, that update must be propagated across every embedded review in the database, whereas in MySQL, a single update in the 'Users' table would suffice.
